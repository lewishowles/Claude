# Claude config improvements — dual-target (Claude + Codex)

**Started:** 2026-05-13  
**Project:** `~/Dev/Configuration/Claude` (renames to `~/Dev/Configuration/Agents` in Phase 9)  
**Status:** in-progress  
**Current priority:** Phase 8 end-to-end validation

## Legend

- `[ ]` not started
- `[~]` in progress
- `[x]` done
- `[-]` skipped/superseded (with reason)

---

## Confirmed Codex behaviour (verified by Lewis)

- **Global rules:** `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` (or `AGENTS.override.md` first if present)
- **Project rules:** walks root → cwd for `AGENTS.override.md` then `AGENTS.md`. Root `AGENTS.md` (real file or symlink) covers both runtimes. `project_doc_fallback_filenames` in `~/.codex/config.toml` works in 0.130.0-alpha.5 but treat as unstable.
- **Skills:** This machine's active Codex setup has core user skills in `~/.codex/skills/`, so this repo uses `~/.codex/skills/<name>` for global symlinks and `.codex/skills/` for project-local Codex skills. `~/.agents/skills/` exists but currently holds caveman/cavecrew extras, not this repo's core skill symlinks. Frontmatter `name`+`description` visible upfront; full skill loaded on use. Implicit matching weights description heavily.
- **Skill discovery:** description-driven, not slash-command. `Use this skill when` + action-led wording + file globs inline = better matching.
- **Hooks:** Codex hooks exist (developers.openai.com/codex/hooks) but parity out of scope. Skill descriptions carry discovery weight.
- **Caveman + claude-mem:** already installed for Codex (caveman manually activated). No further plugin work needed.

## Critical decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| `shared/` + `targets/<agent>/` structure | Single source of truth; agent outputs grouped; hooks move out of root |
| Per-skill, per-hook symlinks (not whole folder) | Coexists with plugin/system-installed skills in `~/.codex/skills/` and `~/.claude/skills/` |
| Root `AGENTS.md` always real file or symlink | Both Claude and Codex read root `AGENTS.md` — one file covers both runtimes |
| `sync.sh` composes from `shared/` | No manual sync between agent files; one place to edit shared rules |
| Interactive default, `--claude/--codex/--both` flags | Accessible for first-time use; flags for repeat runs |
| Repo rename only after Phase 8 validates end-to-end | Avoid disruption during implementation; rename is symbolic milestone |

## Dual-target phases (current priority)

### Phase 0 — Update AGENTS.md and PROGRESS.md

- [x] **0.1** Rewrite `.claude/AGENTS.md` for dual-target purpose, structure, Codex behaviour
- [x] **0.2** Rewrite `.claude/PROGRESS.md` with dual-target phases; mark old Phase 6 superseded

**Working state:** Documentation only. No functional change.

---

### Phase 1 — Skill descriptions + rename `claude-config` → `agent-config`

- [x] **1.1** Rewrite `description` in all 19 `skills/*/SKILL.md` — `Use this skill when` prefix, action-led wording, file globs inline, pair-skill mentions
- [x] **1.2** Rename `skills/claude-config/` → `skills/agent-config/`; broaden content scope to "agent config repo (Claude + Codex)"
- [x] **1.3** Update `hooks/skill-autotrigger.sh` line 50 (continuation list) and line 182 (`claude-config` block)
- [x] **1.4** Update `hooks/skill-file-trigger.sh` lines 67–69 (`claude-config` paths)
- [x] **1.5** Update `settings.json` — `skillOverrides` key `claude-config` → `agent-config`
- [x] **1.6** Update `CLAUDE.md` skills list — `/claude-config` → `/agent-config`
- [x] **1.7** Update `docs/skills.md`, `docs/commands.md`, `docs/hooks.md` — rename references

**Working state:** Claude works with renamed skill and tighter descriptions. Auto-trigger keys updated. No Codex changes yet.

**Validation:**
- `/agent-config` slash command works; `claude-config` no longer exists
- Auto-trigger fires `agent-config` for matching prompts
- Spot-check 3 random skill descriptions for `Use this skill when`, action-led wording, and file globs

---

### Phase 2 — Add `## File discovery` + `## Skill use policy` to `CLAUDE.md`

- [x] **2.1** Add `## Skill use policy` block to `CLAUDE.md`:
  > Skills are authoritative when their trigger conditions match. Before coding, editing prose, changing config, or reviewing files, inspect the task and file paths, then load and use every matching skill. If multiple skills match, use all relevant skills — especially `code-style` plus language/framework skills. Do not wait for explicit slash-command invocation.
- [x] **2.2** Add `## File discovery` block to `CLAUDE.md`:
  > Do not inspect generated, vendored, cached, build, dependency, or large binary directories unless explicitly asked. Prefer `rg` / `rg --files`, which respects `.gitignore` and `.rgignore`. Avoid `find`, broad `ls -R`, or reading ignored paths such as `node_modules`, `dist`, `build`, `.git`, coverage, caches, lockfile-heavy generated output, and local secrets.

**Working state:** Claude immediately benefits. Codex inherits when wired in Phase 3.

**Validation:** Both sections present in `CLAUDE.md`.

---

### Phase 3 — Restructure: `shared/` + `targets/<agent>/` + `scripts/sync.sh`

⚠️ Ship Phase 3 + Phase 4 together. When `hooks/` and `settings.json` move, the existing `~/.claude/hooks` symlink (whole folder) and `~/.claude/settings.json` reference break. Phase 4 setup script re-creates per-item symlinks pointing to new paths.

- [x] **3.1** Create `shared/global-rules.md` — extract General config, Think before coding, When expectations break, Simplicity first, Surgical changes, Communication, Git from `CLAUDE.md`
- [x] **3.2** Create `shared/skills-policy.md` — Phase 2 skill use policy block
- [x] **3.3** Create `shared/file-discovery.md` — Phase 2 file discovery block
- [x] **3.4** Create `shared/identity.md` — Identity & expertise block from `CLAUDE.md`
- [x] **3.5** Create `scripts/lib/colours.sh` — `${GREEN}`, `${PURPLE}`, `${YELLOW}`, `${RED}`, `${RESET_COLOUR}`
- [x] **3.6** Create `scripts/sync.sh` — deterministic concatenation from editable source fragments; composes `targets/claude/CLAUDE.md` (shared + Claude-specific fragments) and `targets/codex/AGENTS.md` (shared + Codex-specific fragments)
- [x] **3.7** Move `hooks/*` → `targets/claude/hooks/`
- [x] **3.8** Move `settings.json` → `targets/claude/settings.json`
- [x] **3.9** Delete root `CLAUDE.md` (superseded by `targets/claude/CLAUDE.md`)

**Working state:** `sync.sh` runs cleanly. Until Phase 4 setup script runs, existing symlinks are broken — include migration note in commit.

**Validation:** `scripts/sync.sh` exits 0; `targets/claude/CLAUDE.md` content equivalent to pre-Phase-3 effective rules + new sections; `targets/codex/AGENTS.md` exists and reads cleanly.

---

### Phase 4 — `scripts/setup-global.sh` + fix `~/.claude/settings.json` drift

- [x] **4.1** Create `scripts/setup-global.sh` with `--claude | --codex | --both`
  - No flag → interactive prompt: "Which agent(s)? [1] Claude  [2] Codex  [3] Both"
  - Self-discovers repo via `REPO_DIR=$(cd "$(dirname "$0")/.." && pwd)`
  - Idempotent; re-run reports `↪ already linked` for unchanged
  - Fail-fast on first error; partial results not rolled back (they're symlinks)
- [x] **4.2** `--claude` symlinks: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `~/.claude/settings.json`, `~/.claude/skills/<name>` ×19, `~/.claude/hooks/<file>` per-hook — all → `repo/targets/claude/`
- [x] **4.3** `--codex` symlinks: `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` → `repo/targets/codex/AGENTS.md`; `~/.codex/skills/<name>` ×19 → `repo/skills/<name>`
- [x] **4.4** Backup strategy (never overwrites, never deletes):
  - Doesn't exist → create symlink → `✓ linked <name>`
  - Symlink → correct repo path → skip → `↪ already linked <name>`
  - Symlink → elsewhere → move to `<path>.bak.<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>`, create new → `⟳ relinked <name>`
  - Real file, no `.bak` → move to `<path>.bak`, create symlink → `⟳ replaced <name> (backup at <bak>)`
  - Real file, `.bak` exists → move to `<path>.bak.<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>`, create symlink → `⟳ replaced <name> (backup at <bak>.<timestamp>)`
  - Runtime-scanned skills/hooks back up under `~/.claude/backups/` or `~/.codex/backups/` so stale backups are not loaded as active skills
- [x] **4.5** Specific drift fix: `~/.claude/settings.json` is currently a real file with `.bak` from 2026-05-14 11:15. Script moves it to `.bak.<timestamp>`, creates symlink → `repo/targets/claude/settings.json`.
- [x] **4.6** Update README with global setup instructions and aliases

**Working state:** Fresh install or migration from old layout — both work via one command. Settings.json drift fixed.

**Validation:** `setup-global.sh --claude` creates per-skill, per-hook symlinks; `~/.claude/settings.json` is a symlink; re-run is idempotent; backups exist for any pre-existing real files.

---

### Phase 5 — `scripts/setup-project.sh`

- [x] **5.1** Create `scripts/setup-project.sh` with `--claude | --codex | --both`; no flag → interactive prompt; skip existing files (no overwrite)
- [x] **5.2** `--claude`: `cp templates/claude/AGENTS.md.template AGENTS.md`; `mkdir -p .claude/`; copy `templates/claude/settings.json`, `templates/claude/.claudeignore`, `templates/PLAN.md.template` → `.claude/templates/`
- [x] **5.3** `--codex`: `cp templates/codex/AGENTS.md.template AGENTS.md`; `mkdir -p .codex/skills`
- [x] **5.4** `--both`: `cp templates/shared/AGENTS.md.template AGENTS.md`; `mkdir -p .claude/`; copy Claude `.claude/` layout; `mkdir -p .codex/skills`

**Working state:** Per-project setup for Claude, Codex, or both via one command. Existing project files are skipped, not overwritten or backed up.

**Validation:** `tests/setup-project.sh` covers each flag in a fresh dir plus re-run skip behaviour.

---

### Phase 6 — Templates filled in

- [x] **6.1** Write `templates/claude/AGENTS.md.template` — project-specific, Claude framing
- [x] **6.2** Write `templates/codex/AGENTS.md.template` — project-specific, Codex framing; no Claude-only references
- [x] **6.3** Write `templates/shared/AGENTS.md.template` — neutral, both runtimes
- [x] **6.4** Move `templates/settings.json` → `templates/claude/settings.json`
- [x] **6.5** Move `templates/.claudeignore` → `templates/claude/.claudeignore`

**Working state:** All `setup-project.sh` flag combinations have valid template inputs.

**Validation:** `tests/setup-project.sh` verifies the selected template marker for Claude, Codex, and both.

---

### Phase 7 — Documentation pass

- [x] **7.1** Rewrite `README.md` — three setup paths (Claude / Codex / both); single-source-of-truth model; alias setup snippet
- [x] **7.2** Create `docs/setup.md` — manual setup steps as fallback
- [x] **7.3** Create `docs/codex.md` — `~/.codex/config.toml` schema, skill loading, hook absence note (link to OpenAI hooks docs as future work), plugin parity notes
- [x] **7.4** Update `docs/hooks.md` — banner: "Claude-only. Codex hooks exist but parity out of scope; skill descriptions carry discovery weight instead."
- [x] **7.5** Update `docs/skills.md` — auto-trigger (Claude) vs description-driven (Codex); note descriptions written for both
- [x] **7.6** Update `docs/plugins.md` — banner Claude-only; Codex marketplace exists; caveman + claude-mem usable in both
- [x] **7.7** Update `docs/commands.md` — rename `/claude-config` → `/agent-config` (completed in Phase 1)
- [x] **7.8** Update `docs/agents.md` — Claude agents only; note distinct from Codex top-level "agents" concept

**Validation:** README links `docs/codex.md`; stale-template-path scan returned no matches.

---

### Phase 8 — End-to-end validation

- [x] **8.1** Run `setup-global.sh --both` on this machine. Verify all symlinks per topology table. Verified `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `~/.claude/settings.json`, `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`, 19 Claude skill symlinks, 7 Claude hook symlinks, and 19 Codex skill symlinks.
- [-] **8.2** Backup `~/.claude/` and `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`. Run script in clean state. Verify same result. Restore. — skipped per Lewis: current setup is fresh; no separate backup/restore validation needed.
- [x] **8.3** In fresh test project: `setup:agents --claude`, then `--codex`, then `--both` — three separate test projects. Verify file layouts. Validated in `/private/tmp/agent-setup-validation.H6aRj1`.
- [x] **8.4** Open Claude in test project — confirms CLAUDE.md + skill descriptions load correctly. Verified global Claude rules and `code-style` skill are available; Claude reads project `AGENTS.md` when following global instructions, not by automatic discovery.
- [x] **8.5** Open Codex in test project — confirms AGENTS.md + skills visible. Verified project `AGENTS.md`, global Codex rules, and `code-style` skill. Fixed strict YAML frontmatter parsing by converting skill descriptions to block scalars; moved stale `*.bak` skill directories out of active scan paths.
- [ ] **8.6** Run `scripts/sync.sh` after editing `shared/global-rules.md`. Diff both targets — confirm both update.

**Working state:** Confidence to ship. Both runtimes verified end-to-end.

---

### Phase 9 — Repo rename `Configuration/Claude` → `Configuration/Agents`

Only after Phase 8 passes.

- [ ] **9.1** `mv ~/Dev/Configuration/Claude ~/Dev/Configuration/Agents`
- [ ] **9.2** Update git remote URL if changed on hosting side
- [ ] **9.3** Update README references to new path
- [ ] **9.4** Update aliases in `~/.zshrc`
- [ ] **9.5** Re-run `setup-global.sh --both` — updates all symlinks to new repo path
- [ ] **9.6** Update `skills/agent-config/SKILL.md` repo path reference
- [ ] **9.7** Update `.claude/AGENTS.md` path references

**Working state:** Final form. Repo name reflects content.

## Script output style

All scripts load from `scripts/lib/colours.sh`. Blank line before/after each section header.

```
→ Setting up Claude (global)

  ✓ linked CLAUDE.md
  ✓ linked skills/vue
  ⟳ replaced settings.json (backup at ~/.claude/settings.json.bak)
  ↪ hooks/check-claude.sh already linked

→ Setting up Codex (global)

  ✓ linked AGENTS.md
  ✓ linked skills/vue

Done.
```

## Deferred phases (Writ-inspired — queued, not blocking dual-target)

### Old Phase 1 — Foundation [x]

- [x] Create `.claude/PROGRESS.md`
- [x] Add skill/hook maintenance rules to `claude-config` skill
- [x] Create `templates/PLAN.md.template`
- [x] Add progress tracking workflow to `session-management` skill

### Old Phase 2 — Slim CLAUDE.md [x]

- [x] Audit and classify CLAUDE.md rules
- [x] Move token efficiency + goal-driven execution → `session-management`
- [x] Remove communicating-with-humans detail
- [x] Verify line count (100 lines, down from 141)

### Old Phase 3 — Plan verify + progress-resume hooks [x]

- [x] Write `hooks/plan-verify.sh` (PostToolUse:ExitPlanMode)
- [x] Write `hooks/progress-resume.sh` (UserPromptSubmit)
- [x] Register both in `settings.json`
- [x] Document in `docs/hooks.md`
- [ ] **3.5 Test:** exit plan mode without Validation section → warning visible; with section → silent
- [ ] **3.6 Test:** "let's continue" in project with PROGRESS.md → content injected; without → silent

### Old Phase 4 — Friction logging [ ] deferred

- [ ] Add friction log write to `pre-stop-checks.sh` — appends timestamp + session summary to `~/.claude/logs/friction.log`
- [ ] Write `scripts/analyze-friction.sh` — parses log, shows top friction causes

### Old Phase 5 — PreWrite test-skeleton gate [ ] deferred

- [ ] Write `hooks/pre-write-test-gate.sh` — detects Vitest/Playwright/Cypress/Jest/XCTest; blocks implementation writes if no matching test file
- [ ] Register in `settings.json`
- [ ] Test in Vitest project: write `.ts` without test file → blocked; write `.test.ts` first → proceeds
- [ ] Test in non-test project: write `.ts` → no interruption

### Old Phase 6 — install.sh [-] superseded

Superseded by `scripts/setup-global.sh` (dual-target Phase 4). Per-skill, per-hook symlinks are a strict improvement over the old whole-folder approach.

---

## Architecture

Enforcement stays in hooks, not prompts. `shared/` is single source of truth for rules. `sync.sh` composes agent-specific outputs deterministically. Setup scripts handle both runtimes from one entry point with a consistent backup strategy.

Progress tracking is flow-driven (updated at task completion), not session-driven — `SessionEnd` doesn't fire reliably when conversations are archived in the desktop app.

After each completed phase or coherent implementation step, provide a ready-to-use Conventional Commit message before moving on to the next step. Keep the message scoped to the work just completed.

## Validation (end-to-end)

Clone repo to clean machine, run `setup:agents:global --both`, then `cd` to a fresh project and run `setup:agents --both`. Both runtimes pick up global rules and project-local instructions.

## Session notes

### 2026-05-13
**Completed:** Old phases 1 & 2 — PROGRESS.md, PLAN.md.template, claude-config skill maintenance rules, session-management skill expanded, CLAUDE.md slimmed 141→100 lines, autotrigger updated  
**Completed (session 2):** Old phase 3 — `plan-verify.sh`, `progress-resume.sh`, registered in settings.json, docs/hooks.md updated  
**Next:** Old phase 3.5–3.6 tests; dual-target phases 0–9

### 2026-05-14
**Completed:** Phase 0 — `.claude/AGENTS.md` and `.claude/PROGRESS.md` rewritten to capture dual-target plan in full  
**Completed (session 2):** Phase 1 — all skill descriptions rewritten with `Use this skill when`, action-led discovery, and file globs; `claude-config` renamed to `agent-config`; hooks/settings/docs updated
**Completed (session 3):** Phase 2 — added `## Skill use policy` and `## File discovery` to `CLAUDE.md`
**Completed (session 4):** Phases 3 and 4 — restructured into `shared/` and `targets/<agent>/`, added `scripts/sync.sh`, moved Claude hooks/settings, removed root `CLAUDE.md`, added global setup script
**Completed (session 4 follow-up):** Refactored `scripts/sync.sh` to join editable source fragments instead of embedding generated prose in the script; clarified project-local `AGENTS.md` template paths in generated Claude and Codex headers
**Next:** Phase 5 — create `scripts/setup-project.sh`

### 2026-05-15
**Completed:** Phases 5, 6, and 7 — added `scripts/setup-project.sh`, split project templates into `templates/claude`, `templates/codex`, and `templates/shared`, added shell tests, rewrote README, added setup and Codex docs, and updated docs banners for Claude-only hooks/plugins/agents
**Validation:** `bash -n scripts/setup-project.sh`; `bash -n scripts/setup-global.sh`; `tests/setup-project.sh`; stale-template-path `rg` scan
**Next:** Phase 8 — run end-to-end global and fresh-project validation, including real symlink topology checks

**Completed (session 2):** Phase 8.1 and 8.3 — ran `scripts/setup-global.sh --both`, verified Claude/Codex global symlinks, skipped clean-state backup validation per Lewis, and validated `setup-project.sh` layouts in three fresh temporary projects
**Validation:** `readlink ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`; `readlink ~/.claude/settings.json`; `readlink ~/.codex/AGENTS.md`; counted 19 Claude skill links, 7 Claude hook links, 19 Codex skill links; checked fresh `--claude`, `--codex`, and `--both` project layouts
**Next:** Phase 8.4/8.5 — launch Claude and Codex in test projects to confirm each runtime loads the generated rules and skills

**Completed (session 3):** Phase 8.4 and 8.5 — validated Claude non-interactive startup with global rules, `code-style`, and project `AGENTS.md` read-through; validated Codex non-interactive startup with project `AGENTS.md`, global rules, and `code-style`
**Validation fixes:** Converted all skill frontmatter descriptions to YAML block scalars for Codex; updated setup backups for runtime-scanned skills/hooks to live under `backups/`; moved stale `~/.codex/skills/*.bak` directories out of the active scan path
**Next:** Phase 8.6 — edit `shared/global-rules.md`, run `scripts/sync.sh`, and confirm both generated targets update
