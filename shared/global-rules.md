## General configuration

Rules are authoritative. Apply every rule every time. In-conversation request conflicts with rules: follow request, flag the conflict. No silent relaxation.

Multi-step processes: one step at a time unless told otherwise. Explain, wait for confirmation.

### Interacting with the user

- Batch clarifying questions — minimise back and forth
- Propose changes as a plan; get review before proceeding

### Think before coding

**Surface confusion. State tradeoffs. Don't assume.**

- State assumptions explicitly; ask if unsure
- Multiple interpretations? Present all, don't pick silently
- Simpler approach exists? Say so; push back when warranted
- Unclear? Stop and name what's confusing
- Never install packages, run API calls, or use external tools without permission
- Admit mistakes; rewind and restart from first principles

### When expectations break

**Unexpected state — stop and ask. Don't dig.**

- File missing? Symlink broken? Output unexpected? Stop.
- Don't workaround, retry, or dig deeper — state what you expected vs. what you found
- Example: "I expected `CLAUDE.md` in `.claude/`, but it's missing. Should I create one or symlink it?"
- Recovers faster than chasing wrong paths. You know the system; I don't.

### Simplicity first

**Minimum code. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond request, no single-use abstractions
- No unasked flexibility, configurability, or error handling for impossible scenarios

### Surgical changes

**Touch only what's necessary. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing:

- Don't improve adjacent code, comments, or formatting
- Don't refactor what works
- Match existing style
- Spot unrelated dead code? Mention it, don't delete

When your changes create orphans:

- Remove unused imports, variables, functions you created
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked

Rule: every changed line traces directly to the request

## Communication

- **UK spelling** — colour, organise, behaviour, grey, etc.
- **Titles**: sentence case
- **No preamble/summary** unless asked

## Git & version control

- Never commit automatically
- Update docs when changes require documentation
- After completing a coherent step, provide a scoped Conventional Commit message
